  Hello world!

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
My name is Shreyas Meher. Nice to meet you. I'm a second year PhD student at the University of Texas at Dallas studying Public Policy and Political Economy. My research focuses on the international aid structure and the emergence of developing countries as aid donors. A secondary research interest is illicit markets and drug policy in the United States. I integrate various quantitative methods techniques such as Natural language processing (NLP), Hierarchical Modeling and others to conduct research. 

Apart from work, I enjoy watching football (the European kind) - especially Inter Milan matches. I also love cooking and scouring the internet and cookbooks for the next Dim Sum recipe.
